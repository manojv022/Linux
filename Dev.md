### Tips for Preparing:
- **Hands-on Practice:** Since DevOps often involves real-time troubleshooting and scripting, it's crucial to have hands-on practice with Linux.
- **Automation Tools Knowledge:** Understanding the common tools for automation and configuration management (Ansible, Puppet, Chef) will help you integrate Linux with DevOps workflows.
- **System Monitoring:** Familiarize yourself with system performance and monitoring tools (e.g., `htop`, `top`, `iotop`, `netstat`, `sar`) for analyzing real-time system health.
- **Understand Virtualization/Containers:** Given the prominence of Docker and Kubernetes in DevOps, understanding how Linux interacts with containers is essential.
