6) Can you explain DHCP and DNS and their importance in networking?
7) What is a VPN, and how does it work?8) What is a MAC address, and what role does it play in networking?
9) What are some common network protocols, and what do they do?
10) What is a firewall, and what are its types?

Basic Concepts in Networking :

*OSI Model: A conceptual framework with 7 layers that standardizes networking functions to enable diverse systems to communicate.

*Subnet: A segmented part of a network, used to improve security and performance by isolating traffic.

*Switch vs. Router: A switch connects devices within a network; a router connects multiple networks and directs data between them.

*IPv4 vs. IPv6: IPv4 uses 32-bit addressing, while IPv6 uses 128-bit, allowing for more unique addresses.

*NAT: Translates private IP addresses to a public IP, allowing multiple devices on a local network to share one public address.

*DHCP & DNS: DHCP automatically assigns IP addresses; DNS translates domain names into IP addresses.

*VPN: Creates a secure, encrypted connection over the internet to protect data during remote access.

*MAC Address: A unique identifier for devices on a network, used to ensure accurate data transmission.

*Network Protocols: Standard rules like TCP, UDP, and HTTP that facilitate reliable data exchange over networks.

*Firewall: A security system that monitors and controls network traffic, preventing unauthorized access.
