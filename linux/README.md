- Use at least 8 characters with a mix of upper/lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.
- Periodically change passwords to minimize exposure risk.
- Avoid sharing passwords.

---

## Using `passwd` Command
The `passwd` command is used to change a user's password and manage password-related settings.

### Syntax:
```bash
passwd [OPTIONS] [USER]
```

### Examples:
- Change the current user’s password:
  ```bash
  passwd
  ```
- Change another user's password (requires root privileges):
  ```bash
  passwd username
  ```
- Lock a user's account:
  ```bash
  passwd -l username
  ```
- Unlock a user's account:
  ```bash
  passwd -u username
  ```
- Expire a user's password to force a reset on the next login:
  ```bash
  passwd -e username
  ```

---

## Password Policy Settings
Password policies help enforce secure practices, such as minimum length or expiration.

### Configure Policies:
Edit `/etc/login.defs` or use PAM modules:
```bash
vi /etc/login.defs
```

Key settings:
- `PASS_MAX_DAYS`: Maximum days before password expiry.
- `PASS_MIN_DAYS`: Minimum days before password change.
- `PASS_MIN_LEN`: Minimum password length.

Example:
```plaintext
PASS_MAX_DAYS   90
PASS_MIN_DAYS   1
PASS_MIN_LEN    8
```

---

## Account Locking and Expiration
Locking accounts can prevent unauthorized logins, while expiration ensures unused accounts are deactivated.

### Lock Account:
```bash
passwd -l username
```

### Set Expiry Date:
```bash
chage -E YYYY-MM-DD username
```

### Check Account Details:
```bash
chage -l username
```

---

## Understanding `/etc/shadow` Fields
The `/etc/shadow` file stores encrypted passwords and account metadata.

### Fields:
```plaintext
username:password:last_change:min_days:max_days:warn:inactive:expire
```
- **username**: User login name.
- **password**: Encrypted password (or `!` for locked accounts).
- **last_change**: Days since epoch when password last changed.
- **min_days**: Minimum days before a password change is allowed.
- **max_days**: Maximum days before a password must be changed.
- **warn**: Days before expiry to warn the user.
- **inactive**: Days after password expiry before account lock.
- **expire**: Absolute account expiry date.

---

## Using `chage` Command
The `chage` command manages password aging and account expiration.

### Syntax:
```bash
chage [OPTIONS] [USER]
```

### Examples:
- View password aging details:
  ```bash
  chage -l username
  ```
- Set maximum password age:
  ```bash
  chage -M 90 username
  ```
- Force password change at next login:
  ```bash
  chage -d 0 username
  ```

---

## Introduction to Linux Groups
Groups allow multiple users to share permissions and access to resources.

### Types of Groups:
1. **Primary Group**: Associated with the user by default (specified during user creation).
2. **Secondary Group**: Additional groups a user is part of.

---

## Fields of `/etc/group` and `/etc/gshadow`

### `/etc/group`:
Contains group information.
```plaintext
group_name:x:GID:members
```
- **group_name**: Name of the group.
- **x**: Placeholder for password (if any).
- **GID**: Group ID.
- **members**: Comma-separated list of group members.

### `/etc/gshadow`:
Contains secure group passwords and metadata.
```plaintext
group_name:password:admin_users:members
```
- **password**: Encrypted group password (rarely used).
- **admin_users**: Users allowed to administer the group.
- **members**: Regular group members.

---

## Managing Groups

### Creating Groups:
```bash
groupadd group_name
```

### Deleting Groups:
```bash
groupdel group_name
```

### Modifying Groups:
- Change group name:
  ```bash
  groupmod -n new_name old_name
  ```
- Change GID:
  ```bash
  groupmod -g new_gid group_name
  ```

---

## Managing Group Memberships

### Add a User to a Group:
```bash
usermod -aG group_name username
```

### Remove a User from a Group:
Edit `/etc/group` manually or use `gpasswd`:
```bash
gpasswd -d username group_name
```

### View Group Memberships:
```bash
groups username
```

---

## Viewing and Editing Group Information

### List All Groups:
```bash
cat /etc/group
```

### View Group Details:
```bash
groupmems -g group_name -l

# Day 11: Managing Users and Permissions in Linux

## Importance of File Permissions in Linux
File permissions play a vital role in Linux security and system stability. They determine who can read, write, or execute files and directories, protecting sensitive data and preventing accidental or malicious changes.

Key reasons for file permissions:
- **System Security**: Prevent unauthorized access.
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure only authorized users can modify data.
- **Operational Stability**: Restrict critical system files from unauthorized modifications.

---

## Explanation of rwx (read, write, execute) Permissions
Linux permissions are represented using three sets of characters:
1. **Read (`r`)**: Allows viewing the contents of a file or listing directory contents.
2. **Write (`w`)**: Allows modifying file contents or creating/deleting files within a directory.
3. **Execute (`x`)**: Allows running a file as a program or accessing a directory.

### Structure of Permissions:
- Permissions are grouped for three categories:
  - **User (u)**: The owner of the file.
  - **Group (g)**: Users in the group assigned to the file.
  - **Others (o)**: All other users.

Example:
```
-rwxr-xr--  1 user group  1024 Dec 18 10:00 example.txt
```
- **`rwx`**: Permissions for the owner (read, write, execute).
- **`r-x`**: Permissions for the group (read, execute).
- **`r--`**: Permissions for others (read only).

---

## How Permissions are Displayed with `ls -l`
The `ls -l` command provides a detailed view of files, including permissions:

Example:
```
$ ls -l
-rw-r--r-- 1 user group  2048 Dec 18 12:00 file.txt
```
### Breakdown of Output:
1. **`-rw-r--r--`**: Permission string.
2. **`1`**: Link count (number of references to the file).
3. **`user`**: File owner.
4. **`group`**: Group assigned to the file.
5. **`2048`**: File size in bytes.
6. **`Dec 18 12:00`**: Last modification date and time.
7. **`file.txt`**: File name.

---

## Breaking Down the Permission String (e.g., `-rwxr-xr--`)
- **First character (`-`)**:
  - `-` indicates a regular file.
  - `d` indicates a directory.
  - `l` indicates a symbolic link.

- **Next nine characters**:
  - `rwx` (owner permissions).
  - `r-x` (group permissions).
  - `r--` (others' permissions).

### Practical Example:
1. Change file permissions to `rw-` for the owner and no access for others:
   ```
   $ chmod 600 file.txt
   ```
2. Verify permissions:
   ```
   $ ls -l
   -rw------- 1 user group 1024 Dec 18 14:00 file.txt
   ```

---

## Introduction to File Types
Files in Linux are categorized into types based on their purpose and usage.

### File Types Displayed by `ls -l`:
- **Regular File (`-`)**: Normal files containing data or text.
- **Directory (`d`)**: Container for other files or directories.
- **Symbolic Link (`l`)**: Shortcut pointing to another file.
- **Socket (`s`)**: Enables inter-process communication.
- **Pipe (`p`)**: Allows data flow between processes.
- **Block Device (`b`)**: Represents a block hardware device (e.g., hard drives).
- **Character Device (`c`)**: Represents a character hardware device (e.g., keyboard).

---

## User Defined File Types
User-defined file types are created by users for specific purposes, such as:
- **Text Files**: Configuration, log, or documentation files.
- **Scripts**: Automating tasks (e.g., shell scripts).
- **Executables**: Compiled programs or binaries.

### Example:
1. Create a text file:
   ```
   $ echo "Hello, Linux" > myfile.txt
   ```
2. Make a script executable:
   ```
   $ chmod +x script.sh
   ```

---

## System Defined File Types
System-defined file types are pre-configured by Linux to manage system functionality:
- **Configuration Files**: Located in `/etc` (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).
- **Libraries**: Shared code used by applications (e.g., `/lib`).
- **Logs**: System and application logs (e.g., `/var/log`).

---

## Practical Scenarios
1. Change directory permissions to allow group members to write:
   ```
   $ chmod g+w /shared-directory
   ```

2. Restrict file access to the owner:
   ```
   $ chmod 700 confidential.txt
   ```

3. Verify file type using `file` command:
   ```
   $ file example.txt
   example.txt: ASCII text
   ```

---

Feel free to experiment with these commands to better understand Linux permissions and file types.

# Day 12: Managing Users and Permissions in Linux

## **Link Count Basics**
### Overview
In Linux, the "link count" refers to the number of references (links) to a particular inode. An inode is a data structure that stores metadata about a file or directory.

### Key Points
1. **Files and Hard Links**: Each file starts with a link count of 1, representing its own name as a reference to its inode.
2. **Directories**: Directories typically have a link count greater than 2 due to `.` (current directory), `..` (parent directory), and subdirectory entries.

### Practical Example
```bash
# Check the link count of files and directories
ls -l
```
Output:
```
drwxr-xr-x  2 user group 4096 Dec 18 10:00 example-dir
-rw-r--r--  1 user group   45 Dec 18 10:00 example-file
```
In the example:
- The directory `example-dir` has a link count of `2`.
- The file `example-file` has a link count of `1`.

## **Link Count for Directories**
1. **Base Count**: A directory always starts with at least two links: `.` (itself) and `..` (parent).
2. **Subdirectories**: Each subdirectory increases the parent directory’s link count by 1.

### Example
```bash
mkdir dir1
mkdir dir1/subdir1
ls -ld dir1
```
Output:
```
drwxr-xr-x  3 user group 4096 Dec 18 10:00 dir1
```
Explanation: `dir1` has three links—`.` (itself), `..` (parent), and `subdir1`.

## **Link Count for Files**
1. **Hard Links**: Creating additional names for the same file increases the link count.

### Example
```bash
ln file1 file2
ls -l
```
Output:
```
-rw-r--r--  2 user group 4096 Dec 18 10:00 file1
-rw-r--r--  2 user group 4096 Dec 18 10:00 file2
```
Explanation: Both `file1` and `file2` reference the same inode, increasing the link count to 2.

## **Comparing Hard and Soft Links**
### Hard Links
- Point to the same inode.
- Cannot span across different file systems.
- Cannot link to directories.

### Soft Links (Symbolic Links)
- Act as a pointer to the original file.
- Can span across file systems.
- Can link to directories.

### Practical Example
```bash
# Hard Link
ln original hardlink
ls -li

# Soft Link
ln -s original softlink
ls -li
```

## **Importance of sudo for Privilege Escalation**
### What is sudo?
- `sudo` allows a permitted user to execute commands as another user, typically root.
- It provides limited and controlled privilege escalation.

### Why Use sudo?
1. Prevent accidental system damage by restricting root access.
2. Provides an audit trail of user activities.
3. Offers flexibility for assigning specific command permissions.

### Example
```bash
# Running a privileged command
sudo apt update
```

## **Difference Between Regular User Commands and sudo Commands**
- Regular commands operate within the user's permission scope.
- `sudo` commands run with elevated privileges, allowing access to restricted operations.

### Example
```bash
# Regular user command
ls /root

# sudo command
sudo ls /root
```
Output:
```
Permission denied
# With sudo
<content of /root directory>
```

## **Configuring sudo Access**
1. **Edit sudoers File**:
   Use the `visudo` command to safely edit the `/etc/sudoers` file.

2. **Granting User Permissions**:
   Add specific users or groups:
   ```
   username ALL=(ALL) ALL
   ```

3. **Restricting Commands**:
   Limit commands a user can run:
   ```
   username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/reboot
   ```

### Example
```bash
# Add user to sudo group
sudo usermod -aG sudo username
```

## **sudo Command Syntax and Example**
### Syntax
```bash
sudo [options] [command]
```
### Common Options
- `-l`: List sudo privileges.
- `-u`: Specify a target user.
- `-k`: Reset the timestamp.

### Practical Examples
```bash
# Running as a different user
sudo -u otheruser whoami

# Running a command without saving the password timestamp
sudo -k apt install nginx
```

---
By mastering these concepts and commands, you can efficiently manage users and permissions in Linux. Practice with real-world scenarios to solidify your understanding!

# Day 14: Automation and Data Handling in Linux

## Overview of Archiving
Archiving is the process of combining multiple files and directories into a single file. This is especially useful for backups, data transfer, and organization.

### Common Use Cases:
1. **Backups:** Safeguard data by creating archives that can be stored securely.
2. **Data Transfer:** Simplify sharing by bundling multiple files into a single archive.
3. **Organization:** Group related files for better management.

## Creating and Extracting Archives with `tar`

### **Creating an Archive:**
```bash
# Syntax:
tar -cvf archive_name.tar file1 file2 directory/

# Example:
tar -cvf project_backup.tar project_folder/
```
- **Options:**
  - `-c`: Create an archive.
  - `-v`: Verbose output (show progress).
  - `-f`: Specify the file name.

### **Extracting an Archive:**
```bash
# Syntax:
tar -xvf archive_name.tar

# Example:
tar -xvf project_backup.tar
```
- **Options:**
  - `-x`: Extract an archive.

### **Managing Archive Contents:**
- **View Contents of an Archive:**
```bash
tar -tvf archive_name.tar
```
- **Add Files to an Existing Archive:**
```bash
tar -rvf archive_name.tar new_file.txt
```
- **Remove a File from an Archive (requires `--delete` option):**
```bash
tar --delete -f archive_name.tar unwanted_file.txt
```

## Introduction to Compression
Compression reduces file sizes by encoding data efficiently. It helps save storage and speeds up data transfer.

### **Common Compression Formats:**
- **gzip:** Good compression and widely supported.
- **bzip2:** Better compression than gzip but slower.
- **xz:** Best compression but slowest.

### **Using gzip and gunzip:**
- **Compress a File:**
```bash
gzip file_name
```
- **Decompress a File:**
```bash
gunzip file_name.gz
```

### **Using bzip2 and bunzip2:**
- **Compress a File:**
```bash
bzip2 file_name
```
- **Decompress a File:**
```bash
bunzip2 file_name.bz2
```

### **Using xz and unxz:**

```bash
xz file_name
```
- **Decompress a File:**
```bash
unxz file_name.xz
```

## Combining Archiving and Compression

### **Create a Compressed tar Archive:**
- Using gzip:
```bash
tar -czvf archive_name.tar.gz file1 file2 directory/
```
- Using bzip2:
```bash
tar -cjvf archive_name.tar.bz2 file1 file2 directory/
```
- Using xz:
```bash
tar -cJvf archive_name.tar.xz file1 file2 directory/
```

### **Extract a Compressed tar Archive:**

```bash
tar -xJvf archive_name.tar.xz
```

## Practical Examples
### **Compressing Files:**
```bash
# Compress using gzip:
tar -czvf documents.tar.gz Documents/

# Compress using bzip2:
tar -cjvf logs.tar.bz2 Logs/

# Compress using xz:
tar -cJvf archive.tar.xz Folder/
```

### **Decompressing Files:**
```bash
# Decompress using gzip:
tar -xzvf documents.tar.gz

# Decompress using bzip2:
tar -xjvf logs.tar.bz2

# Decompress using xz:
tar -xJvf archive.tar.xz
```

## Introduction to CronTab
CronTab allows scheduling of recurring tasks such as backups, system updates, and cleanup scripts.

### **Understanding the CronTab Syntax:**
CronTab entries have five fields:
```
* * * * * command_to_execute
- - - - -
| | | | |
| | | | +----- Day of the week (0 - 7) (Sunday = 0 or 7)
| | | +------- Month (1 - 12)
| | +--------- Day of the month (1 - 31)
| +----------- Hour (0 - 23)
+------------- Minute (0 - 59)
```

### **Creating and Managing Cron Jobs:**
- **View Existing Cron Jobs:**
```bash
crontab -l
```
- **Edit Cron Jobs:**
```bash
crontab -e
```
- **Delete All Cron Jobs:**
```bash
crontab -r
```

### **Practical Examples:**
1. **Automate Backups Every Day at Midnight:**
```bash
0 0 * * * tar -czvf /backup/home_$(date +\%F).tar.gz /home/user/
```
2. **Clean Temporary Files Every Week:**
```bash
0 0 * * 0 rm -rf /tmp/*
```
3. **Run a System Update Every Month:**
```bash
0 2 1 * * apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y
```

### **Validate Cron Jobs:**
Use the `journalctl` command to check logs and ensure jobs run as scheduled:
```bash
journalctl -u cron
```
